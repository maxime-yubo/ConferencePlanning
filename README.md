_A sample iOS app demonstrating how to implement a **Live Activity**._


## 🎤 Context

This project was built as part of my talk at [**Swift Connection 2025**](https://swiftconnection.io), where I introduced the fundamentals of **Live Activities** on iOS  
_(in 10 minutes. yeah, it's short)_.  

The goal of this sample is to keep things **simple and focused**, showing the essential pieces needed to get a Live Activity up and running.  
It can be used as a starting point to try things out by yourself.
